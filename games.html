              Frog and Croc is a 3D retro platformer that I made with a team for my Game Development class. The team
              consisted of three programmers and one artist. I was in charge of gameplay programming, level design, UI,
              sound programming, and voice acting. This game was inspired by 3D platformers and collectathons from the
              late 1990's and the early 2000's.
              The gameplay is based on the concept of controlling 2 characters with different abilities to solve
              navigational puzzles, fight enemies, and platform across the island
              in order collect all of the golden clams.

            <h4>Reflector VR</h4>
            <p class="text-white-50 mb-0">
              This game was made as a final project for my Interactive Virtual Environments class. I worked with a team
              consisting of four artists and two programmers on a VR game that we named
              Reflector VR. I worked on gameplay programming, level design, and AI behavior.
              In this game, the player is put in the center of a testing facility where turrets appear all around the
              player in a circle
              and bombard them with lasers fired from all directions. The player has a shield, which reflects the lasers
              back to the turrets,
              and a gun that can fire small lasers in quick succession. There are a total of three levels in which the
              goal is to destroy all
              the turrets and
              survive until the end of the game.

      <h4>Dungeon in the Dark</h4>
      <p class="text-white-50 mb-0">
        I developed this game for my Intro to Video Game Level Design course. I was the only developer on this project, but I was able to use
        environment assets, gameplay code, music, and sound effects from Unity's Asset Store and the YouTube audio library.
        Other than a few code snippets from the Asset Store, I was responsible for all of the programming as well as the level design, set dressing, and lighting.
        I wanted to make a first-person horror game where the primary source of horror is in the environment, rather than from constant threat.  
    By having the environment as a looming threat to the player, the majority of the scares happen in the player's mind rather than in the game.
    I used the design philosophy present in several popular horror games like P.T. and Amnesia to make my own horror game.

      <h4>Honey Up!</h4>
      <p class="text-white-50 mb-0">
        In Chillennium 2019, I formed a team with three of my friends - two artists and one other programmer. The
        theme for this game jam was "one for all, and all for one".
        I worked on gameplay programming, AI navigation, and UI. We created a real-time-strategy game called Honey
        Up! where the player dispatches bees from a hive in order to collect nectar from flowers. The collected
        nectar can be used
        to create one of three different types of bees, each with different attributes. Nectar can also be used to
        buy honey, which is the main goal of the game. Lastly,
        nectar can be used to upgrade the beehive, which increases the range of flowers that the bees can fly to,
        increases the amount of honey that can be made and stored, and increases
        the total number of bees that the player can have.

        I've participated in Chillennium every year for 4 years, and I'd always hoped that my team's game would
        win an award. I am incredibly happy to announce that this game won First Place Overall.
        There were more than 400 participants that came from other universities, states, and even other countries,
        and there were approximately 90 games that were submitted and judged. I feel incredibly honored to receive
        this award, and I am very thankful for my teammates participating in this game jam with me.

                  The game we created was a 2D puzzle-platformer where the player is meant to control a construction worker
                  to reach the flag at the end of the level. In each level, the player is responsible for placing a limited
                  number of
                  platforms in order to cross the gap to reach the goal on the other side. This game was a Chillennium Award
                  Finalist.

      <h4>Summon the Spellbook</h4>
      <p class="text-white-50 mb-0">
        Since the summer of 2019, I have been working with three of my friends on a game that I've had the idea for
        since 2016. I am currently working on gameplay programming and level design.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white-50 mb-0">In this game, you will play as a young girl who
        comes from the wind village and starts with only knowing a single wind spell that she keeps in her spell
        book. Throughout the game, the young girl will travel to
        various locations and conquer dungeons and temples spread all over the region. In each dungeon, the young
        girl will add a spell to her spell book.
        The spells found in the dungeons will help the girl complete her spell book by filling in the missing spells
        - the fire spell, the ice spell, and the thunder spell.
        The goal of the game is to complete the spell book by conquering all of the dungeons.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white-50 mb-0">
        The main mechanic of the game is combining spells to unleash new attacks. Up to this point, I have currently
        implemented the wind spell, which stuns enemies and knocks back
        both enemies and other objects, and the fire spell, which is a swipe from a sword made of fire. The fire
        sword can be used to light
        torches and deal damage to enemies. If the player uses both spells at the same time, they throw a fire
        boomerang which returns to the player after a certain amount
        of time.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white-50 mb-0">
        The first dungeon is currently being developed in Unity. I created two sample dungeons to showcase the
        mechanics
        and the general ideas I have for the game. I plan to continue development with my team and finish a complete
        dungeon in the near future.
