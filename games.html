                      I am working on <i>Exodus</i> as a Technical Combat Designer, primarily responsible for all things AI, including enemies, bosses, and (to a lesser extent) companions.
                      During my time here, I have gotten to design entirely new enemy factions and bosses from scratch, and see their design through all the way to getting a fully-playable experience in-game.
                      In my work, I am able to exercise both parts of the game development skillset I have built up over my career - coming up with designs and implementing them.
                      No other job has allowed me to express myself quite like my role working on <i>Exodus</i>, and I am extremely grateful to be a part of our very talented team.

                      <i>Crowfall</i> is a player-versus-player sandbox MMORPG with a focus on territory acquisition and
                      control.
                      I always explain it to people who are unfamiliar with it as "it's like the board game Risk, but as
                      an MMO".
                      The game originally started as a Kickstarter back in 2015 and has operated as a live-service game
                      since the beginning of development.

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      I worked on <i>Crowfall</i> for about a year before it went live, so my work primarily consisted of bug
                      fixing and polishing
                      in preparation for our launch date. However, I was given ownership of the audio system, the
                      in-game map system, and
                      varoius UI elements, so the majority of my work was involved in those systems.

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      My absolute favorite part of the job was collaborating with designers, artists, and other engineers
                      to implement new game features from game design documents and technical design documents. I was heavily involved in
                      the implementation of a few key game systems, as well as a major contributor to a
                      new game mode that was implemented pre-launch.

                    <div class="mini_spacer"></div>

                    <p class="mb-5"></p>
                    My largest and most involved contribution to the game was assisting with the implementation of a
                    60-player battle royale mode called HungerDome.
                    In HungerDome, players are split up into teams of 5 and asked to
                    do whatever it takes to survive against other teams as well as an encroaching disease called The
                    Hunger.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5"></p>
                    This game mode makes heavy use of the game's territory capture system,
                    which awards teams that successfully capture the various locations on the map with the opportunity
                    to buy enhanced equipment.
                    Owning one of these capturable locations also offers a chance at respawning if any team member meets their demise on the battlefield.
                    The only catch is that your
                    soul needs to fly to your captured location before The Hunger can consume it!
                    At the center of the map rests a castle, which, when captured, provides the best rewards of any of
                    the
                    capturable locations, making it a valuable point of contention near the end of the match.
                    </p>

                      title="A HungerDome team attempts to fight a Gryphon with the hope that it drops powerful loot." />

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      My efforts for HungerDome primarily were directed towards creating a matchmaking screen where players could
                      select their character for the match and
                      team up with their friends or find random teams online.
                      I was responsible for all of the client-side programming involved in getting the team roster
                      screen to function, and I
                      also worked very closely with our Platform team to architect a client-server messaging contract system so
                      that the client could
                      send up relevant information to the server, and the server could propagate information to all
                      clients involved in the team.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      HungerDome was implemented in order to host a pre-launch tournament that aimed to attract
                      player attention for the game close to our launch date.
                      Unfortunately, the player numbers we experienced
                      pre and post-launch did not merit extending HungerDome to become a persistant stand-alone game mode,
                      and was phased out until more development
                      time could be put into it. All of the HungerDome tournament rounds can be found on <a

                      <i>Frog and Croc</i> is a 2000's-era-inspired third-person platformer that I made with a team for my Game Development
                      class.
                      The team
                      consisted of three programmers, including myself, and one artist. I was in charge of gameplay
                      programming, level
                      design,
                      UI design,
                      audio programming, and voice acting.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      This game was inspired by 3D platformers and collectathons from the
                      late 1990's and the early 2000's, such as <i>Super Mario 64</i> and <i>Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for
                      Bikini
                      Bottom</i>, while also taking on the design philosophies from newer entries in the genre.
                      Since I grew up with these kinds of games, I knew what made them special. With this game, I wanted
                      to
                      replicate the
                      feel of being a kid playing a game on your GameCube on a lazy Saturday morning.

                    <h1>Design Philosophies</h1>
                    <hr class="d-none d-lg-block mb-0 ml-0">

                    <p class="mb-5">
                    <ol>
                      At the beginning of development, I established a few core design philosophies that I wanted to
                      adhere to for the duration of the project:
                      <br><br>
                      <li class="text-justify">A "show, don't tell" approach to introducing new game mechanics.
                        I knew that every introduction of a new gameplay mechanic needed a tutorial to properly teach
                        the player, but I didn't
                        want the player to feel like they were going through a tutorial. I'm a firm believer in never
                        insulting the player's intelligence with
                        a hand-holding approach for explaining exactly how to play the game.</li>
                      <li class="text-justify">Every platform and prop should be realistic for our setting.
                        In essence, that means no artificially floating platforms, or placing platforms simply for the sake of
                        providing a platforming challenge
                        - every object should be a believable piece of the environment. This philosophy
                        takes a page directly from
                        <i>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze's</i> level design approach.</li>
                      <li class="text-justify">Movement shouldn't have to rely on the environment
                        in order to be fun. We wanted our character movement to be fun even if the player was stuck in
                        an empty room.
                        I believed that if we could make the very act of moving enjoyable, then we would have a
                        promising 3D platformer on our hands.
                        To accomplish this, I took inspiration from <i>Mario Odyssey's</i> movement system - Mario has such a
                        diverse set of movement options with
                        controls that naturally form logical combinations of moves when combined together.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      Both Frog and Croc each have unique and complex movesets that can be used to navigate the island's
                      various areas.
                      The island contains various doors that only open when the player has found a specified number of
                      clams.
                      There are a total
                      of 20 clams in the game.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The first area of the game is Frog and Croc's home, which is right next to an obstacle course and
                      playground
                      that the player can use to learn the mechanics in a safe environment. All mechanics are available
                      to the
                      player at
                      the start of the game, so I had to design the levels so that the player wouldn't feel overwhelmed
                      with
                      the number of
                      options they had at their disposal. This meant that I had to use a limited number of mechanics in
                      the beginning levels
                      and build up the player's knowledge over the course of the game until I can design a
                      more complex challenge for the player, and be confident that they can overcome it.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The second area of the game is the Tiki Forest. This area introduces the player to enemies as well
                      as
                      combat.
                      This area has a large tree in the middle of a forest clearing that the player must swing around as
                      Frog
                      in order to collect
                      a golden clam that is up too high to jump to.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The third area of the game is the Shoreline. This area is much larger and more spread out than the
                      forest.
                      Here, 2 new enemy types are introduced and the player must utilize their learned abilities to
                      gather all of the clams in
                      this
                      area.
                      For instance, an exploding enemy must be picked up and thrown and some oddly-colored rocks with a
                      yellow glow. These rocks
                      will crumble when the exploding enemy blows up near them, which reveals a golden clam.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The fourth area of the game is the most complex - the Volcano. The player must ascend a large
                      volcano
                      using every mechanic they
                      have learned up to this point. I wanted to have multiple paths up the mountain for observant
                      players. In
                      fact, there are
                      a total of three paths that the player can traverse! Once the player has gathered all of the
                      golden
                      clams in this area, they
                      can destroy the cork that is plugging up the entrance to the volcano, which allows them to go
                      inside.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The final area of the game is a boss battle against a giant version of a previously seen enemy. In
                      classic 3D platformer fashion,
                      the enemy can be destroyed in 3 hits. Destroying the boss Tiki grants the player a Giant Golden
                      Clam,
                      which is worth four golden clams.
                      This brings the player's total clam count to 20, and they can now traverse the entire island
                      however
                      they please!
                    </p>

                      <i>Dungeon in the Dark</i> is a first-person horror game that I developed for my Intro to Video Game
                      Level Design class. I was the only developer on this project.
                      Other than a few code snippets from the Unity Asset Store, I was responsible for all of the
                      programming as well as the level design, set dressing, and lighting.
                      Sound effects and art assets all came from the Unity Asset Store and the YouTube audio library.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      I wanted to make a first-person horror game where the primary source of horror comes from the
                      environment, rather than from some kind of monster.
                      By having the environment as a looming threat to the player, the majority of the scares happen in
                      the player's mind rather than in the game.
                      This is the design philosophy present in several popular horror games like <i>P.T.</i> and <i>Amnesia</i>, which
                      were big influences
                      on this game.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      <ol>
                        I did a lot of research on modern horror games in order figure out how developers are able to make 
                        players feel a sense of dread. Going into this project, I wanted to accomplish the following design goals:
                        <br><br>
                        <li class="text-justify">
                          Use the feeling of suspense, rather than going for constant scares. Fear of the unknown is often so much scarier than fearing something 
                          that you can visualize. Imagination is a powerful tool that can be exploited to make a situation seem far scarier than it actually is.
                          As soon as the player has something concrete to place their fear in, they will develop ways to
                          cope with the horror and lessen its impact. It's kind of like giving a birthday present - when it's inside the box, the gift recipient is filled with excitement
                          as they speculate what could be inside. When they open the present, all of those possibilities vanish, and the reality of the present is revealed. And while it 
                          might still be a good present, the gift recipient's mind doesn't dwell on it like it would if it were unopened. In this sense, a wrapped gift is better than an opened gift.
                          <br><br>
                          A few ways this was used in practice was through the use of scripted sound-cues at various points in the level, the use of amorphous shadows moving 
                          across walls, making the level dimly lit,  adding a dark fog to prevent the player from being able to see too far in front of them, and ensuring 
                          that all hallways have sharp turns so as to force the player to make blind turns at every corner.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li class="text-justify">
                          Use jumpscares sparingly. The way I think about it is that every player has a "Tension Meter". While playing a scary game, the Tension Meter continues to go up
                          while no scares are happening. This is because the player has the expectation that something scary <i>will</i> happen at some point during the game, and the longer they go without
                          getting scared, the more tense the player experience becomes. They adopt the mindset of "surely, a scare must be right around the corner".
                          The aim is to let this Tension Meter fill up to max capacity before actually scaring the player, as that will have the greatest effect. 
                          When a scare finally does occur, the Tension Meter becomes nearly depleted, and must be built back up again. For this reason, games with constant 
                          jumpscares are not as effective - they do not give the player time to fill up their Tension Meter for maximum impact.
                          <br><br>
                          There are a few jumpscares that I use in the level to capitalize on the Tension Meter - the first is an eerie sound cue that plays as a shadow darts 
                          across a wall, the second is a monster screech as the player crosses the bridge, and the third is a loud sound accompanied with VFX when part of the 
                          hallway collapses in front of the player.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li class="text-justify">
                          Player death, especially at the hands of something you want the player to fear, should be kept to an absolute minimum. When your character dies in a video game, it
                          breaks immersion and affords the player an opportunity to step back and ground themselves in reality again. This completely resets the Tension Meter, which is likely 
                          at maximum capacity if the player is directly interacting with a fear inducing object, so the potential scare gets entirely thrown away.
                          Additionally, if the player repeatedly dies to the same fear-inducing object, all the fear that was once there may be directed to frustration. In this sense, 
                          the most impactful horror game would be one where you can never die.
                          <br><br>
                          I attempted to manipulate the monster AI such that it would be hard, but not impossible, to be killed by it. Additionally, during the chase sequence, if the player 
                          manages to get very far away from the pursuing monster, I have the AI speed up so that they catch up to the player, but will not reach them unless they stand still.

                      When the game starts, the player spawns facing a door with sunlight visible from the gaps between the door and the wall.
                      Most players attempt to open
                      the door only to find that it is locked. The goal of the game is to unlock this door and escape.

                      to progress. Later the player must explore the environment for bridge pieces that are needed to
                      cross a gap. I added props to this area that
                      contain some unnerving imagery, such as weapons and bones scattered about.

                      across a table, as if in preparation
                      for evisceration.

                      The final part of the game involves the player retrieving a key from a dark chamber 
                      inhabited by a monster. After the player secures the key, all torches in the level are extinguished,
                      and a chase sequence is started. The player must quickly make their way back to the door at the 
                      beginning of the level in order to escape. I was so happy with how tense this section of the game was!
                      The entire atmosphere of the game was building up to this moment, and I'm very pleased with how it turned out.

                      I had been working on a game design document for a Zelda-inspired top-down dungeon-crawling
                      adventure game on my own time,
                      but this particular level of the game was made for my Level Design class. All of the programming,
                      game design, and
                      level design was done by me.

                      I have a vision for a much larger adventure for which this level is a small part of.
                      However, in this version, you play as a knight that hails from the fire village and
                      begins the adventure only knowing a single fire spell that they keep in their spellbook.
                      The idea is that, throughout the game, the knight will travel to
                      various locations and conquer dungeons and temples spread all over the region.
                      In each dungeon, the knight will add a spell to their spell book.
                      In addition to the fire spell, there are three missing spells
                      - the wind spell, the ice spell, and the thunder spell.
                      The goal of the game is to complete the spell book by conquering all of the dungeons.

                      The core mechanic in the game is combining different elemental spells in order to unleash new attacks. Up to this point, I have
                      currently
                      implemented the wind spell (which stuns enemies and knocks back
                      both enemies and other objects), and the fire spell (which summons a sword made of fire which can
                      be used to light
                      torches and deal damage to enemies). If the player uses both spells at the same time, they throw a
                      fire
                      boomerang which will return after a short amount
                      of time. The idea for the game is that every spell can be combined to unleash a new combination

                      use the fire spell and
                      what kind of environmental effects it can have, such as lighting torches on fire and reflecting
                      projectiles. At the
                      midpoint of the dungeon, the player will find the wind spell and will be introduced to a type of
                      enemy that is on fire and is invulnerable to the player's fire spell.
                      Since the wind spell can put out fire, the player must put out the enemy's fire before being able
                      to damage them with the fire
                      spell.

                      <i>Honey Up!</i> is a a real-time-strategy game that was developed in 48 hours as part of the Chillennium
                      2019 game jam.
                      I worked on a four person team consisting of two artists and two programmers, including myself. I
                      worked on gameplay
                      programming, AI programming, and level design.
                      The theme for this game jam was "all for one, and one for all".
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      This game is like a weird mashup of <i>Plants Versus Zombies</i> and <i>Cookie Clicker</i>.
                      The player assumes charge of a colony of bees, and they must create enough honey
                      to fill the honey bar. The hive starts off with only a single bee, but through hard work, you can
                      increase
                      your bee count all the way up to a maximum of 100 bees!

                      To make honey, the player needs to collect nectar, which is the main resource in this game.
                      To get nectar, the player must dispatch bees from the hive to the surrounding flowers.
                      Bees can only carry one nectar at a time, which they must then deposit in the hive in order for
                      the player's
                      total nectar count to increase. However, these bees are smart, and they will continue traveling
                      from the hive
                      to the selected flower until all of the nectar has been collected. The flowers will replenish
                      their nectar over time.

                      The collected
                      nectar can be used
                      to create one of three different types of bees, each with different attributes. There are Normal
                      Bees, which
                      have average speed and average health. There are Beefy Bees, which have a lot of health, but
                      travel slower. And lastly,
                      there are Fast Bees, which travel at higher speeds and have less health. Each bee type is valuable
                      for certain activities
                      and each bee costs a different amount of nectar to produce.

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      Nectar can also be used to
                      buy honey, or "Honey Up!", which is the main goal of the game. The total amount of honey that you
                      can store in your hive depends on your hive size.
                      Which brings us to the last item that you can buy with nectar.

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      Nectar can be used to upgrade the beehive, or "Hive Up!", which increases the range of flowers
                      that the bees can fly to,
                      increases the amount of honey that can be made and stored, and increases
                      the total number of bees that the player can have. Upgrading the hive early is important because
                      it allows you to make more
                      bees! This creates an interesting gameplay loop of balancing short term versus long term goals.

                      would
                      win an award. I am incredibly happy to announce that this game won First Place Overall.
                      There were more than 400 participants that came from other universities, states, and even other
                      countries,
                      and there were approximately 90 games that were submitted and judged. I feel incredibly honored to
                      receive
                      this award, and I am very thankful for my teammates participating in this game jam with me.

                      <i>Block Builder: City Escape</i> is a 2D puzzle-platformer that was developed in 48 hours as part of the
                      Chillennium 2018 game jam.
                      I worked in a group of three programmers, including myself. I worked on gameplay programming,
                      level design, and animation programming. The theme for this game jam was "transformation".

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      I have always loved playing around with level editors in video games, and one of my favorite games
                      at the time of creating <i>Block Builder</i> was
                      <i>Super Mario Maker</i>. As such, I was inspired to adhere to the game jam's theme of "transformation"
                      by having
                      the player transform the level as they're playing through it - it's sort of like using a real-time
                      level editor.

                      a player can place
                      to get to the end. Additionally, each different placeable block has its own properties, which are

                      introduced to the player as they progress.

                      The first level introduces the player to non-moving blocks and falling blocks. The player has a
                      set number of
                      falling blocks that they can place in order to reach the platform. As a failsafe, the game also
                      has the option to delete the block that
                      you just placed down as well as reset the current level back to its default state. We found that,
                      during playtesting, some players got into a situation
                      where they placed their blocks in such a way that it was impossible to reach the goal, so we
                      implemented this feature to solve that issue.

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The second level shows the player that falling blocks will stop when they come into contact with
                      the cloud block, which is
                      immoveable. The player now has access to both falling blocks and cloud blocks that they must use
                      to reach the flag pole.
                    </p>

                      The third level teaches the plyer how to use the green bouncy platforms. The player has to control
                      their momentum so that they
                      do not fall to their doom. This level also gives the player a few safety cloud blocks (for those
                      that like to take the easy way out).
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The fourth level contains the last kind of block - the speedy block. This block increases the
                      player's speed as they move across it.
                      I set up a situation in this level where a speedy block is placed right next to a bouncy block.
                      When the player goes across these two
                      blocks in sequence, their momentum is conserved through the jump, and they are able to travel much
                      further in order to cross the gap to the other side.

                      The last level provides the player with a playground to use every kind of block that they have
                      been introduced to. This level is the
                      most vertically oriented, so the player must come up with a way to rapidly gain height. There is
                      no single correct way to complete this
                      stage, which makes it really fun and unique!

                      it did become a Chillennium Award Finalist.

                      Reflector VR is a first-person VR game that was made as a final project for my Interactive Virtual
                      Environments class. I worked on a team
                      consisting of four artists and two programmers, including myself.
                      I worked on gameplay programming, level design, and AI programming.

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      There are a total of three levels in which the
                      goal is to destroy all
                      the turrets and escape from the testing facility!

                      At the start of the game, the player receives both a laser pistol and a transparent shield. The
                      player
                      can use the laser pistol to shoot enemy turrets to destroy them. Additionally, the player can also
                      use their shield to reflect
                      lasers back towards the turret that fired it. All of the UI is displayed on the player's shield,
                      which is easy to see in the middle of combat!
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      Since this game was made using SteamVR's Unity API and an HTC Vive, the player has the option to
                      physically dodge incoming lasers
                      matrix-style, which feels really awesome while you're playing the game, but looks really silly to
                      anyone
                      who sees you in the real world.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      One challenge we ran into while developing this game was that players would frequently drop their
                      pistol and shield out of bounds, which
                      made the rest of the game impossible to play. To fix this, I created a capsule hitbox around the
                      player's platform that forced the
                      pistol and shield to bounce back into bounds if they ever went outside of the reachable zone.
                    </p>

                      The first level is located on the bottom floor of the testing facility. Stationary turrets will
                      rise from the ground
                      around the player in a circle. They will only begin firing once the player has turned towards
                      them, which prevents the player from being
                      shot by a turret that they didn't even know existed. When all turrets have been defeated, the
                      platform that the player is standing
                      on rises upwards like an elevator. We tested the rising speed for motion sickness, and the speed
                      we used was found to be the least
                      nauseating.

                      The second level puts the player in the center of 4 walkways. Crawling turrets spawn at the ends
                      of the walkways and will slowly
                      make their way towards the player's position. Unlike the turrets on the first floor, these turrets
                      shoot streams of fire that can be
                      blocked by the shield, or dissipated with a few laser shots. Since these turrets are so slow,
                      their fire does a lot of damage over time,
                      so don't let them get too close!

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The third and final level pits the player against hordes of flying turrets that fire two lasers at
                      a time. This is the the most hectic and intense level!
                      Each flying turret takes only 1 shot to destroy, so these turrets drop like flies, which is
                      incredibly
                      satisfying. Once the player clears this stage, they ride the elevator up to the top floor where a
                      surprise is waiting...

                      The whole testing facility is actually in space! I wanted to let the player have some fun once
                      they got here, so I wrote a script that
                      disabled the
                      gravity on the barrels when the player shot them.
