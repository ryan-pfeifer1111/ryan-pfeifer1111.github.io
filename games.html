                      Frog and Croc is a retro third-person platformer that I made with a team for my Game Development
                      class.
                      The team
                      consisted of three programmers and one artist. I was in charge of gameplay programming, level
                      design,
                      UI,
                      audio programming, and voice acting.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      This game was inspired by 3D platformers and collectathons from the
                      late 1990's and the early 2000's, such as Super Mario 64 and Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for
                      Bikini
                      Bottom.
                      Since I grew up with these kinds of games, I knew what made them special. With this game, I wanted to
                      replicate the
                      feel of being a kid playing a game on your Gamecube on a lazy Saturday morning.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      This game has the player swap between two characters, creatively named Frog and Croc. I'll let you
                      figure out who is who.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      Both Frog and Croc each have unique and complex movesets that can be used to navigate the island's
                      various areas.
                      The island contains various doors that only open when the player has found a specified number of
                      clams.
                      There are a total
                      of 20 clams in the game.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The first area of the game is Frog and Croc's home, which is right next to an obstacle course and
                      playground
                      that the player can use to learn the mechanics in a safe environment. All mechanics are available
                      to the
                      player at
                      the start of the game, so I had to design the levels so that the player wouldn't feel overwhelmed
                      with
                      the number of
                      options they had at their disposal.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The second area of the game is the Tiki Forest. This area introduces the player to enemies as well
                      as
                      combat.
                      This area has a large tree in the middle of a forest clearing that the player must swing around as
                      Frog
                      in order to collect
                      a golden clam that is up too high to jump to.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Portfolio Modal - Image-->

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The third area of the game is the Shoreline. This area is much larger and spread out than the
                      forest.
                      Here, 2 new enemy types are introduced and the player must utilize their special properties to gather all of the clams in
                      this
                      area.
                      For instance, and exploding enemy must be picked up and thrown and some oddly-colored rocks with a
                      yellow glow. These rocks
                      will crumble when the exploding enemy blows up near them, which reveals a golden clam.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The fourth area of the game is the most complex - the Volcano. The player must ascend a large
                      volcano
                      and use every mechanic they
                      have learned up to this point. I wanted to have multiple paths up the mountain for observant
                      players. In
                      fact, there are
                      a total of three paths that the player can traverse! Once the player has gathered all of the
                      golden
                      clams in this area, they
                      can destroy the cork that is plugging up the entrance to the volcano, which allows them to go
                      inside.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The final area of the game is a boss battle against a giant version of a previously seen enemy. In
                      classic 3D platformer fashion,
                      the enemy can be destroyed in 3 hits. Destroying the boss Tiki grants the player a Giant Golden
                      Clam,
                      which is worth four golden clams.
                      This brings the player's total clam count to 20, and they can now traverse the entire island
                      however
                      they please!
                    </p>

                      Reflector VR is a first-person VR game that was made as a final project for my Interactive Virtual
                      Environments class. I worked with a team
                      consisting of four artists and two programmers.
                      I worked on gameplay programming, level design, and AI programming.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      There are a total of three levels in which the
                      goal is to destroy all
                      the turrets and escape from the testing facility!
                    </p>
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/ReflectorVR/Shield.jpg" alt="" />
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/ReflectorVR/Score.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      At the start of the game, the player receives both a laser pistol and a transparent shield. The player
                      can use the laser pistol to shoot enemy turrets to destroy them. Additionally, the player can also use their shield to reflect
                       lasers right back at the turret that shot it. All of the UI is displayed on the player's shield,
                      which is easy to see in the middle of combat!
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      Since this game was made using SteamVR's Unity API and an HTC Vive, the player has the option to physically dodge incoming lasers
                      matrix-style, which feels really awesome while you're playing the game, but looks really silly to anyone
                      who sees you in the real world.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      One challenge we ran into while developing this game was that players would frequently drop their pistol and shield out of bounds, which
                      made the rest of the game impossible to play. To fix this, I created a capsule hitbox around the player's platform that forced the 
                      pistol and shield to bounce back into bounds if they ever went outside of the reachable zone.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The first level is located on the bottom floor of the testing facility. Stationary turrets will rise from the ground
                      around the player in a circle. They will only fire once the player has looked at them, which prevents the player from being
                      shot by a turret that they didn't even know existed. When all turrets have been defeated, the platform that the player is standing
                      on rises upwards like an elevator. We tested the rising speed for motion sickness, and the speed we used was found to be the least
                      nauseating.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The second level puts the player in the center of 4 walkways. Crawling turrets spawn at the ends of the walkways and will slowly 
                      make their way towards the player's position. Unlike the turrets on the first floor, these turrets shoot streams of fire that can be 
                      blocked by the shield, or dissipated with a few laser shots. Since these turrets are so slow, their fire does a lot of damage over time,
                      so don't let them get too close! 
                    </p>
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/ReflectorVR/Level3.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The third and final level pits the player against hordes of flying turrets that fire two lasers at a time. This is the the most hectic and intense level!
                     Each flying turret takes only 1 shot to destroy, so these turrets drop like flies, which is incredibly 
                      satisfying. Once the player clears this stage, they ride the elevator up to the top floor where a surprise is waiting...
                    </p>
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/ReflectorVR/Space.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The whole testing facility is actually in space! I wanted to let the player have some fun once they got here, so I wrote a script that
                      disabled the 
                      gravity on the barrels when the player shot them.
                    </p>

                      Dungeon in the Dark is a first-person horror game that I developed for my Intro to Video Game
                      Level Design class. I was the only developer on this project.
                      Other than a few code snippets from the Unity Asset Store, I was responsible for all of the
                      programming as well as the level design, set dressing, and lighting.
                      Sound effects and art assets all came from the Unity Asset Store and the YouTube audio library.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      I wanted to make a first-person horror game where the primary source of horror comes from the environment, rather than from some kind of monster. 
                      By having the environment as a looming threat to the player, the majority of the scares happen in the player's mind rather than in the game.
                      This is the design philosophy present in several popular horror games like P.T. and Amnesia, which were big influences
                      on this game.
                    </p>
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/DungeonInTheDark/LockedDoor.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      When the game starts, I spawned the player facing a door with light shining through underneath. Most players attempt to open
                      the door only to find that it is locked. The goal of the game is to unlock this door and escape.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The first part of the game introduces the player to levers, which are used throughout the game to open the doors needed
                      to progress. Later the player must explore the environment for bridge pieces that are needed to cross a gap. The set-dressing 
                      contains some unnerving imagery, such as weapons and bones.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      Later, the player will find a torture room with skeletons impaled by metal spikes and splayed across a table, as if in preparation
                      for evisceration.

                      Honey Up! is a a real-time-strategy game that was developed in 48 hours as part of the Chillennium
                      2019 game jam.
                      I worked in a four person team consisting of two artists and two programmers. I worked on gameplay
                      programming and AI programming.
                      The theme for this game jam was "one for all, and all for one".
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      This game is like a weird mashup of Plants Versus Zombies and Cookie Clicker.
                      Throughout the game, the player is in charge of a colony of bees, and they must create enough honey
                      to fill the honey bar. The hive starts off with only a single bee, but through hard work, you can increase
                      your bee count to 100 bees!
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      To make honey, the player needs to collect nectar, which is the main resource in this game.
                      To get nectar, the player must dispatch bees from the hive to the surrounding flowers. 
                      Bees can only carry one nectar at a time, which they must then deposit in the hive in order for the player's 
                      total nectar amount to increase. However, these bees are smart, and they will continue traveling from the hive
                      to the selected flower until all of the nectar has been collected. The flowers will replenish their nectar over time.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The collected
                      nectar can be used
                      to create one of three different types of bees, each with different attributes. There are Normal Bees, which 
                      have average speed and average health. There are Beefy Bees, which have a lot of health, but travel slower. And lastly,
                      there are Fast Bees, which travel at higher speeds and have less health. Each bee type is valuable for certain activities
                      and each bee costs a different amount of nectar to produce.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      Nectar can also be used to
                      buy honey, which is the main goal of the game. The total amount of honey that you can store in your hive depends on your hive size.
                      Which brings us to the last item that you can buy with nectar.

                      Nectar can be used to upgrade the beehive, which increases the range of flowers that the bees can fly to,
                      increases the amount of honey that can be made and stored, and increases
                      the total number of bees that the player can have. Upgrading the hive early is important because it allows you to make more 
                      bees! This creates an interesting gameplay loop of balancing short term versus long term goals.

                      I've participated in Chillennium every year for 4 years, and I'd always hoped that my team's game would
                      win an award. I am incredibly happy to announce that this game won First Place Overall.
                      There were more than 400 participants that came from other universities, states, and even other countries,
                      and there were approximately 90 games that were submitted and judged. I feel incredibly honored to receive
                      this award, and I am very thankful for my teammates participating in this game jam with me.

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      Block Builder: City Escape is a 2D puzzle-platformer that was developed in 48 hours as part of the
                      Chillennium 2018 game jam.
                      I worked with a group of three programmers. I worked on gameplay programming,
                      level design, and animation programming. The theme for this game jam was "transformation".
                    </p>

                     <p class="mb-5">
                       I have always loved playing around with level editors in video games, and one of my favorite games at the time of creating Block Builder was
                       Super Mario Maker. As such, I was inspired to adhere to the game jam's theme of "transformation" by having
                       the player transform the level as they play it.
                     </p>

                     <p class="mb-5">
                       There are a total of 5 levels in the game where the player must fill in enough platforms in order to reach the 
                       flagpole at the end of the stage. Each stage poses a limit on the number and types of blocks that a player can place
                       to get to the end. Additionally, each different placeable block has its own properties, which are gradually
                       introduced to the player as they progress.
                     </p>
                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/BlockBuilder/Level1NoBlocks.jpg" alt="" />
                     <p class="mb-5">
                       You play as a construction worker who is trying to build up a skyscraper. 
                       Each level's background gets higher and higher off the ground as the levels progress.
                     </p>
                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/BlockBuilder/Level1.jpg" alt="" />
                     <p class="mb-5">
                       The first level introduces the player to non-moving blocks and falling blocks. The player has a set number of
                       falling blocks that they can place in order to reach the platform. The game has the option to delete the block that 
                       you just placed down as well as resetting the level back to its default state in case you place the blocks in such a way
                       that prevents you from reaching the goal.
                     </p>
                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/BlockBuilder/Level2.jpg" alt="" />
                     <p class="mb-5">
                       The second level shows the player that falling blocks will stop when they come into contact with the cloud block, which is
                       immoveable. The player now has access to both falling blocks and cloud blocks that they must use to reach the flag pole.
                     </p>
                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/BlockBuilder/Level3.jpg" alt="" />
                     <p class="mb-5">
                       The third level teaches the plyer how to use the green bouncy platforms. The player has to control their momentum so that they
                       do not fall to their doom. This level also gives the player a few safety cloud blocks (for those that like to take the easy way out).
                     </p>
                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/BlockBuilder/Level4.jpg" alt="" />
                     <p class="mb-5">
                       The fourth level contains the last kind of block - the speedy block. This block increases the player's speed as they move across it.
                       I set up a situation in this level where a speedy block is placed right next to a bouncy block. When the player goes across these two
                       blocks in sequence, their momentum is conserved through the jump, and they are able to travel much further. 
                     </p>
                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/BlockBuilder/Level5.jpg" alt="" />
                     <p class="mb-5">
                       The last level provides the player with a playground to use every kind of block that they have been introduced to. This level is the
                       most vertically oriented, so the player must come up with a way to rapidly gain height. There is no single correct way to complete this
                       stage, which makes it really fun and unique!
                     </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      During the judging process, this game made it to the final rounds! While this game did not ultimately win any awards,
                      it did become a Chillennium Award Finalist.

                      This game is currently in development, and has made incremental progress since the summer of 2019.
                      I have been working with three other people to design and implement the game mechanics.
                      This particular level of the game was made for my Level Design class. All of the programming and
                      level design was done by me, and all of the art assets and music
                      were received from the Unity Asset Store, YouTube music artists, and other free online sources.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      As of right now, most of these art assets and sounds are placeholders. I have a vision for a larger adventure for
                      which this level is a small part of.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">In the full game, you will play as a young girl who
                      comes from the wind village and starts with only knowing a single wind spell that she keeps in her spell
                      book. Throughout the game, the young girl will travel to
                      various locations and conquer dungeons and temples spread all over the region. In each dungeon, the young
                      girl will add a spell to her spell book.
                      In addition to the wind spell, there are three missing spells
                      - the fire spell, the ice spell, and the thunder spell.
                      The goal of the game is to complete the spell book by conquering all of the dungeons. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      The main mechanic of the game is combining spells to unleash new attacks. Up to this point, I have currently
                      implemented the wind spell, which stuns enemies and knocks back
                      both enemies and other objects, and the fire spell, which is a swipe from a sword made of fire. The fire
                      spell can be used to light
                      torches and deal damage to enemies. If the player uses both spells at the same time, they throw a fire
                      boomerang which returns to the player after a certain amount
                      of time. The idea for the game is that every spell can be combined to unleash a new combination spell!
                    </p>
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/Spellbook/2Torches.jpg"alt="" />
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      In this dungeon, you start with the fire spell. The first few rooms teach the player how to use the fire spell and
                      what kind of environmental effects it can have, such as lighting torches on fire and reflecting projectiles. At the 
                      midpoint of the dungeon, the player will find the wind spell and will be introduced to a type of enemy that is on fire. 
                      Since the wind spell can put out fire, the player must put out the enemy's fire before being able to damage them with the fire 
                      spell. 
                    </p>

                      The dungeon ends with a showdown against a large fire enemy with three phases.

                      In addition to this dungeon, I have created a few other small dungeons where I am testing different mechanics that
                      I would like to add into the game, like enemies that look like crates but when you pick them up they attack you. Fun stuff.

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      I plan to continue development in the near future.
