                  This game was made as a final project for my Interactive Virtual Environments class. I worked with a team
              consisting of four artists and two programmers on a VR game that we named
              Reflector VR. I worked on gameplay programming, level design, and AI behavior.
              In this game, the player is put in the center of a testing facility where turrets appear all around the
              player in a circle
              and bombard them with lasers fired from all directions. The player has a shield, which reflects the lasers
              back to the turrets,
              and a gun that can fire small lasers in quick succession. There are a total of three levels in which the
              goal is to destroy all
              the turrets and
              survive until the end of the game.

                <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
                  In Chillennium 2019, I formed a team with three of my friends - two artists and one other programmer. The
              theme for this game jam was "one for all, and all for one".
              I worked on gameplay programming, AI navigation, and UI. We created a real-time-strategy game called Honey
              Up! where the player dispatches bees from a hive in order to collect nectar from flowers. The collected
              nectar can be used
              to create one of three different types of bees, each with different attributes. Nectar can also be used to
              buy honey, which is the main goal of the game. Lastly,
              nectar can be used to upgrade the beehive, which increases the range of flowers that the bees can fly to,
              increases the amount of honey that can be made and stored, and increases
              the total number of bees that the player can have.

              I've participated in Chillennium every year for 4 years, and I'd always hoped that my team's game would
              win an award. I am incredibly happy to announce that this game won First Place Overall.
              There were more than 400 participants that came from other universities, states, and even other countries,
              and there were approximately 90 games that were submitted and judged. I feel incredibly honored to receive
              this award, and I am very thankful for my teammates participating in this game jam with me.

                  level design, and animation programming. The theme for this game jam was "transformation".
                  The game we created was a 2D puzzle-platformer where the player is meant to control a construction worker
                  to reach the flag at the end of the level. In each level, the player is responsible for placing a limited
                  number of
                  platforms in order to cross the gap to reach the goal on the other side. This game was a Chillennium Award
                  Finalist.

                  I developed this game for my Intro to Video Game Level Design course. I was the only developer on this project, but I was able to use
                  environment assets, gameplay code, music, and sound effects from Unity's Asset Store and the YouTube audio library.
                  Other than a few code snippets from the Asset Store, I was responsible for all of the programming as well as the level design, set dressing, and lighting.
                  I wanted to make a first-person horror game where the primary source of horror is in the environment, rather than from constant threat.  
              By having the environment as a looming threat to the player, the majority of the scares happen in the player's mind rather than in the game.
              I used the design philosophy present in several popular horror games like P.T. and Amnesia to make my own horror game.
