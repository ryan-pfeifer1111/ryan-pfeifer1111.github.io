      <h1>Schoolwork</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>C++ is the primary programming language used in the majority of my courses. As such, I have extensive experience with object oriented programming as well as both high and low
          level programming concepts. Other languages that were used in my courses include Java, Haskell, and Python. I have also taken courses in Data Structures and Algorithms as well as Discrete Mathematics.
        </p>
        <h2>Computer Organization</h2>
        <p>In this course, we were instructed to build all of the hardware and software components that make a computer function. 
          I was exposed to many low-level programming concepts in this course including assembly and machine language code.</p>
        <p>I built a fully-functional computer from first principles and built and successfully ran rudimentary graphics on it. 
           I also learned how to construct basic logic gates, as well as arithmetic, logic, and sequential chips. 
           I crafted a simple processor architecture through an intuitive machine language supported with implementation of 
           higher abstractions including a virtual machine, compiler, and a high-level object oriented language.</p>
        <p>As an end-of-course project, I created a game using the computer we had constructed.</p>

        <h2>Computer Systems</h2>
        <p>I constructed and learned about several different components that make up a UNIX operating system.</p>
        <p>I used C++ in conjunction with a UNIX library to create a buddy allocator memory system, a bash shell, and the standard inter-process communication methods-
          namely shared memory, named and unnamed pipes, and message queues.
        </p>
        <h2>Programming Studio</h2>
        <p>This course allowed me to work in different groups to produce several software projects.</p>
        <p>For 2 of the projects, I volunteered to be the team leader and learned how to manage a group of programmers efficiently
          in order to produce a project before the deadline. The projects taught me how to create and use databases, client-server relationships, 
          basic artificial intellegence concepts, and graphical user interfaces. 
        </p>
        <p>My final group project involved creating a graphical user interface for a game I had previously made. I also had to consult a chosen panel of reviewers
          who critiqued the game after each step in the development process. The resulting game is a culmination of the suggestions of the users as well as 
          quality-of-life improvements implemented by the developers.
