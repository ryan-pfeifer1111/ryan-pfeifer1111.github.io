      <h1>Schoolwork</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>C++ is the primary programming language used in the majority of my courses. As such, I have extensive experience with object oriented programming as well as both high and low
          level programming concepts. Other languages that were used in my courses include Java, Haskell, and Python. I have also taken courses in Data Structures and Algorithms as well as Discrete Mathematics.
        </p>
        <h2>Computer Organization</h2>
        <p>In this course, we were instructed to build all of the hardware and software components that make a computer function. 
          I was exposed to many low-level programming concepts in this course including assembly and machine language code.</p>
        <p>I built a fully-functional computer from first principles and built and successfully ran rudimentary graphics on it. 
           I also learned how to construct basic logic gates, as well as arithmetic, logic, and sequential chips. 
           I crafted a simple processor architecture through an intuitive machine language supported with implementation of 
           higher abstractions including a virtual machine, compiler, and a high-level object oriented language.</p>
        <p>As an end-of-course project, I created a game using the computer we had constructed.</p>

        <h2>Computer Systems</h2>
        <p>I constructed and learned about several different components that make up a UNIX operating system.</p>
        <p>I used C++ in conjunction with a UNIX library to create a buddy allocator memory system, a bash shell, and the standard inter-process communication methods-
          namely shared memory, named and unnamed pipes, and message queues.
        </p>
        <h2>Programming Studio</h2>
        <p>This course allowed me to work in different groups to produce several software projects.</p>
        <p>For 2 of the projects, I volunteered to be the team leader and learned how to manage a group of programmers efficiently
          in order to produce a project before the deadline. The projects taught me how to create and use databases, client-server relationships, 
          basic artificial intellegence concepts, and graphical user interfaces. 
        </p>
        <p>My final group project involved creating a graphical user interface for a game I had previously made. I also had to consult a chosen panel of reviewers
          who critiqued the game after each step in the development process. The resulting game is a culmination of the suggestions of the users as well as 
          quality-of-life improvements implemented by the developers.

          <h2>Chillennium</h2>
          <p>Chillennium is an annual student-led 48 hour game design competition. A theme is provided by the organization and then teams of up to 4 work together to design a game within the allotted time
            and in accordance with the given theme. The games will be graded by judges after the game jam finished. Prizes are then given out according to grade relative to all other games. I have participated every year since 2016.
          </p>
          <p>In Chillennium 2016, I was in a group with people I had never met before- two artists and an animator with me as a programmer. This was my first Chillennium annd my first time using Unity and C#.
              The theme for this game jam was foofaraw. We ended up creating was a 2D platformer with 3 levels where the main character was a princess that yeilded a realistic-looking pistol that she used to 
              defeat enemies in her way. Since I was the only programmer, I constructed the game phyisics and rules.
          </p>
          <p>In Chillennium 2017, I was in a group with one friend and two strangers- two artists with my friend and myself as the programmers. I learned from Chillennium 2016 that an iterative level-based design 
            was very hard to make on a short time crunch, so I went in to this Chillennium with the idea to create a shorter game that can be replayed multiple times. The theme for this game jam was role reversal.
            The game we created was a two-player 2D game where every 30 seconds, the character each player controls switches. The goal of the game is to fill up a wheelbarrel with a certain amount of candy.
            However, the two players are competing to see who can contribute more candy to the pile. Whoever contributes more candy wins once the candy quota is met. I worked on the game physics and rules of this game.

          <p>In Chillennium 2018, I was in a group with one friend and one stranger- all of us were programmers, but one of us was assigned to be an artist. The theme for this game jam was transformation.
            The game we ended up making was a build-your-own-level puzzle game. The player controls a caracter from the start to the goal of each level. However, there are not enough platforms for the player
            to reach the goal, so we implemented a building system where the player can place a limited number of platforms in order to reach the goal. I worked on some of the game phyisics and rules as well 
            as the level design of each of the 5 levels. This game was a finalist, but unfortunately did not win an award.

          <h2>Sound Visualizer</h2>
          <p>I had always wanted a sound visualizer for Spotify like the one that comes built into iTunes. This motivated me to want to make an online sound visualizer using HTML and JavaScript.
            I used an API called the Web Audio API that can continuously analyze the frequencies and volume of an inputted sound. I used this functionality to make boxes raise and lower depending on
            which frequencies are the loudest at any given time. It can only take in mp3 files currently, but I have plans to improve this project and potentially integrate it with Spotify accounts.

          <h2>Random Choice Generator Android App</h2>
          <p>Whenever I have to decide where my friends and I should go eat, I often find myself overwhelmed with choices. To remedy this, I created an android app that, when given a set of inputted
            choices, will pick a random choice from the list. This has resovled many mental deadlocks for my friends and me. I made this app using Android Studio, which uses primarily Java for the 
            backend and an extremely customizable XML for the front end.

          <h2>Elementary School Coding Lessons</h2>
          <p>One of my parents is a 5th grade teacher and she has told me about how her school takes 1 day out of the school year to teach coding to children of all ages. I then offered to provide
            lessons to her students during my breaks from school, and she accepted. I now go twice a year, once during winter break and once during summer break, to teach her students how to code.
            I've done several lessons with her students including C++ AI, a Java text-based game, and a game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The students are always very excited to learn, and I find 
            it extremely rewarding to pass on some of my knowledge so that some of her students may pursue computer science.

          <h2>Aggie Coding Club</h2>
          <p>Aggie Coding Club is an ogranization at Texas A&M Universirty that promotes teamwork on extracurricular projects. Every semester, we have project groups meet during the week to develop
            some kind of software as a team. The project ideas come from members and the project managers volunteer their time to lead a group to finish a project.
             I have been a member of the Aggie Coding Club since 2016. I was selected to be a project manager by the officers for two consecutive semesters. The first team I led was creating an
            app to help factory workers voice their complaints with working conditions anonymously over SMS messaging. The other team I led wanted to make an app for resitent advisors in on-campus dorms.
            The app would contain an easy lookup for rules and emergency protocols that the resident advisors would be able to access much quicker than their current method of filpping through a large 
            stack of papers to find their issue. Unfortunately, neither of these projects started development while I was project manger, but I organized braninstorming meetings every week and 
            we were able to make a lot of progress before the semester was over.
          </p>
          <p>I was also a team member in the construction of the Aggie Coding Club website. This was my first experince with web development. We used React.js to edit the existing website. I mainly edited
            and organized the existing HTML and CSS files to make future development easier and more streamlined.

          <h2>TAMUhack and HowdyHack</h2>
          <p>TAMUhack is a 24 hour hackathon hosted by Texas A&M that takes place every year. Each contestant has the option to join a team or work solo. I participated in the Fall 2016
            TAMUhack and I tested my abilities with Python and created a simple statistical analysis program that, when given a set of data, can return the mean, median, mode, range,
            standard deviation, and various other data.
          </p>
          <p>See my Python project <a href="https://github.com/ryan-pfeifer1111/TAMU-hack-2016" target="_blank">here</a></p>
          <p>HowdyHack is a hackathon that is hosted by Aggie Coding Club, and the rules are the same as TAMUhack. I worked with one other person when I participated in the Fall 2018
            HowdyHacck. Together, we brainstormed an idea to create a chatbot that professors can use to provide answers to their students for frequently asked questions. For example,
            if a student wants to know the date of the next exam, rather than sending an email to the professor, the idea was to make a chatbot that a professor can customize and link on
            their teacher website that will answer the student's question. We made a prototype using Microsoft Azure, which makes use of natural language processing and machine learning to
            match a set of questions to a set of answers.
