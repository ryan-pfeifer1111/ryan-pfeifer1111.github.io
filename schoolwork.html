          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>C++ is the primary programming language used in the majority of my courses. As such, I have extensive
            experience with object oriented programming as well as both high and low
            level programming concepts. Other languages used in my courses include Java, Haskell, Python, and
            Matlab.
            I have also taken courses in Data Structures and Algorithms as well as Discrete Mathematics.

          <h2>Computer Organization</h2>
          <p>In this course, we were instructed to build all of the hardware and software components that make a
            computer function.
            I was exposed to many low-level programming concepts in this course including assembly and machine
            language.</p>
          <p>I built a fully functional computer from first principles and built and successfully ran rudimentary
            graphics on it.
            I also learned how to construct basic logic gates, as well as arithmetic, logic, and sequential chips.
            I crafted a simple processor architecture through an intuitive machine language supported with
            an implementation of
            higher abstractions including a virtual machine, compiler, and a Java-based high-level object oriented
            language called Jack.</p>
          <p>As an end-of-course project, I created a game using the computer we had constructed.</p>

          <h2>Computer Systems</h2>
          <p>I constructed and learned about several different components that make up a UNIX operating system.</p>
          <p>I used C++ in conjunction with a UNIX library to create a memory management system, a bash shell, and
            several inter-process communication methods- shared memory,
            named and unnamed pipes, and message queues. I also utilized threads and semaphores to implement
            client-server relationships to allow for data transfer.

          <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
          <p>Throughout the duration of this course, I created a simple operating system that can be booted from an image file.</p>
          <p>The operating system I made was written in C++. The components that I made included a frame manager and page manager to implement
            virutal memory, threads and a thread scheduler, and support for multiprogramming with I/O bound threads.

          <h2>Programming Studio</h2>
          <p>This course allowed me to work in different groups to produce several software projects. For each project,
            we used Git for source control.</p>
          <p>I volunteered to be the team leader and learned how to manage a group of programmers efficiently
            so we could produce a project before the deadline. The projects taught me how to create and use
            client-server relationships, databases,
            basic artificial intelligence concepts, and graphical user interfaces. We also learned how to develop
            projects using Agile methodology.
          </p>
          <p>My final group project involved creating a graphical user interface for a game we had previously made. We
            also had to consult a chosen panel of reviewers
            who critiqued the game after each step in the development process. The resulting game is a culmination of
            the suggestions from the users as well as
            quality-of-life improvements implemented by the developers.

          <h2>Computer Graphics</h2>
          <p>This course used matrix transformations and lighting algorithms to explore the fundamentals of computer graphics.</p>
          <p>The projects in this class all used the OpenGL library in C++. The projects I completed included making a rasterizer, utilizing
            hierarchical transformations, writing shaders and making materials for multiple objects in a scene, and using spline curves
            to interpolate a model between keyframes.
