            <h2>Chillennium</h2>
            <p>Chillennium is an annual student-led 48 hour game design competition. A theme is provided by the
              organization and then teams of up to 4 work together to design a game within the allotted time
              and in accordance with the given theme. The games are graded by judges after the game jam is finished.
              Awards are then given out according to the judge's scores.
              I have participated every year since 2016.

          <p id="chillennium2016Animator">In Chillennium 2016, I was in a group with 3 other people I had never met
            before- two artists and an animator. I was the sole programmer for this game.
            This was my first Chillennium and my first time using Unity and C#. The theme for this game jam was
            "foofaraw". We created a 2D platformer with 3
            levels where the main character was a princess that yielded a realistic-looking pistol that she used to
            defeat enemies in her way. Since I was the only programmer, I constructed the game physics and rules.
          </p>
          <div id="chillennium2017Animator">
            <p>In Chillennium 2017, I was in a group with one friend and two strangers- the two strangers were artists,
              and my friend and I were both programmers. I learned from Chillennium 2016 that an iterative
              level-based game was very hard to make in 48 hours, so I went in to this Chillennium with the idea to
              create a shorter game that can be replayed multiple times.
              The theme for this game jam was "role reversal". The game we created was a two-player 2D game where every
              30 seconds, the controls for each player switches,
              causing them to control the other player's character. The goal of the game is to fill up a wheel barrel
              in the center of the level with a certain amount of candy.
              However, the two players are also competing to see who can contribute more candy to the pile. Whoever
              contributes more candy to the pile once the candy quota is met is the winner of the game.
              I worked on the game physics, rules, and animations.

            <p>In Chillennium 2018, I was in a group with one friend and one stranger- all of us were programmers, but
              one of us was assigned to be an artist. The theme for this game jam was "transformation".
              The game we created was a 2D puzzle-platformer. The player is meant to control a construction worker to
              reach the flag at the end of each level. However, there are not enough platforms for the player
              to reach the goal, so we implemented a building system where the player can place a limited number of
              platforms in order to reach the goal. I worked on the game physics, rules,
              the level design of each stage, and animations. This game was a Chillennium Award Finalist.

          <h2>Elementary School Coding Lessons</h2>
          <p>My step mom is a 5th grade teacher and she has told me about how her school participates in the Hour
            of Code, which aims to teach coding to children of all ages. The students were very
            receptive to the Hour of Code, so my step mother asked me to come to her class and teach coding lessons to
            her students during my breaks from school.
          </p>
          <p>I've done several lessons with her students including a tic-tac-toe AI in C++, a rock-paper-scissors game
            in Java, and a mouse-clicking game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            The students are always very excited to learn, and I find it extremely rewarding to pass on some of my
            knowledge so that some of her students may pursue computer science in the future.

          <h2>Hackathons</h2>
          <p>TAMUhack is a 24 hour hackathon hosted by Texas A&M that takes place every year. Each contestant has the
            option to join a team or work solo.</p>
            <p> I participated in the Fall 2016
            TAMUhack individually. I practiced my skills with Python and created a simple statistical analysis program
            that, when given a set of data, can return the mean, median, mode, range,
            standard deviation, and various other data.

          <p>I participated in the Spring 2019 TAMUhack in a group of 5 programmers. We worked on a browser application using Node.js.
            Our goal was to create an online multiplayer game where users are all presented with a tweet from Twitter and
            are prompted to give the tweet a hashtag. All players vote on their favorite hashtag, and the user with 
            the most votes at the end of the round is the winner. I worked on the front end of the website with one other person
             and we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>HowdyHack is a hackathon that is hosted by Aggie Coding Club, and the rules are the same as TAMUhack. I
            worked with one other person when I participated in the Fall 2018
            HowdyHack. Together, we brainstormed an idea to create a chatbot that professors could use to provide
            answers to their students for frequently asked questions. For example,
            if a student wants to know the date of the next exam, rather than sending an email to the professor, the
            idea was to make a chatbot that a professor can customize and link on
            their teacher website that will answer the student's question. We made a prototype using Microsoft Azure,
            which makes use of natural language processing and machine learning to
            match a set of questions to a set of answers.

          <h2>Aggie Coding Club</h2>
          <p>Aggie Coding Club is an organization at Texas A&M University that promotes teamwork on extracurricular
            projects. Every semester, we have project groups meet during the week to develop
            some kind of software as a team. The project ideas come directly from members, and the project managers are
            selected to lead a group to work on a project.
          </p>
          <p>I have been a member of Aggie Coding Club since 2016. I was selected to be a project manager by the
            officers for two consecutive semesters. The first team I led was creating an
            app to help factory workers voice their complaints with working conditions anonymously over SMS messaging.
            The other team I led wanted to make an app for resident advisors in on-campus dorms.
            The app would contain an easy lookup system for rules and emergency protocols that the resident advisors would be
            able to access much quicker than their current method of flipping through a large
            stack of papers.
          </p>
          <p>I was also a team member in the construction of the Aggie Coding Club website. This was my first
            experience with web development. We used React.js to edit the existing website. I mainly edited
            and organized the existing HTML and CSS files to make future development easier and more streamlined.

          <h2>Random Choice Generator Android App</h2>
          <p>Whenever I have to decide where my friends and I should go eat, I often find myself overwhelmed with
            choices. To remedy this, I created an android app that, when given a set of inputted
            choices, will pick a random choice from the list. This has resolved many mental deadlocks for my friends
            and me. I made this app using Android Studio, which uses Java for the
            backend and an extremely customizable XML for the front end.

          <p>I had always wanted a sound visualizer for Spotify like the one that comes built into iTunes. This
            motivated me to want to make an online sound visualizer using HTML and JavaScript.
            I used an API called the Web Audio API that can continuously analyze the frequencies and volume of an
            inputted sound. I used this functionality to make boxes raise and lower depending on
            which frequencies are the loudest at any given time. It can only take in mp3 files currently, but I have
            plans to improve this project and potentially integrate it with Spotify.

          <p>Greenfoot is a simple game development engine that uses Java to display graphics and control gameplay. I
            had attempted to make a game that
            emulates the style of a game called Undertale. I wanted to see if I could implement the gameplay and rules
            of Undertale, so I created a game that uses many of the art assets
            and music from the game.
