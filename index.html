        <h1>Schoolwork</h1>
          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>C++ is the primary programming language used in the majority of my courses. As such, I have extensive experience with object oriented programming as well as both high and low
            level programming concepts. Other languages that were used in my courses include Java, Haskell, Python, and Matlab. 
            I have also taken courses in Data Structures and Algorithms as well as Discrete Mathematics.
          </p>
          <h2>Computer Organization</h2>
          <p>In this course, we were instructed to build all of the hardware and software components that make a computer function. 
            I was exposed to many low-level programming concepts in this course including assembly and machine language.</p>
          <p>I built a fully functional computer from first principles and built and successfully ran rudimentary graphics on it. 
             I also learned how to construct basic logic gates, as well as arithmetic, logic, and sequential chips. 
             I crafted a simple processor architecture through an intuitive machine language supported with implementation of 
             higher abstractions including a virtual machine, compiler, and a Java-based high-level object oriented language called Jack.</p>
          <p>As an end-of-course project, I created a game using the computer we had constructed.</p>

          </div>
          <h2>Computer Systems</h2>
          <p>I constructed and learned about several different components that make up a UNIX operating system.</p>
          <p>I used C++ in conjunction with a UNIX library to create a memory management system, a bash shell, and several inter-process communication methods- shared memory,
             named and unnamed pipes, and message queues. I also utilized threads and semaphores to implement client-server relationships to allow for data transfer.
          </p>
          <h2>Programming Studio</h2>
          <p>This course allowed me to work in different groups to produce several software projects. For each project, We used Git for source control.</p>
          <p>I volunteered to be the team leader and learned how to manage a group of programmers efficiently
            so we could produce a project before the deadline. The projects taught me how to create and use  client-server relationships, databases,
            basic artificial intelligence concepts, and graphical user interfaces. We also learned how to develop projects using Agile methodology.
          </p>
          <p>My final group project involved creating a graphical user interface for a game we had previously made. We also had to consult a chosen panel of reviewers
            who critiqued the game after each step in the development process. The resulting game is a culmination of the suggestions from the users as well as 
            quality-of-life improvements implemented by the developers.

            <h2>Chillennium</h2>
            <p>Chillennium is an annual student-led 48 hour game design competition. A theme is provided by the organization and then teams of up to 4 work together to design a game within the allotted time
              and in accordance with the given theme. The games will be graded by judges after the game jam finished. Awards are then given out according to grade relative to all other games. 
              I have participated every year since 2016.
            </p>
            <p>In Chillennium 2016, I was in a group with 3 other people I had never met before- two artists and an animator. I was programmer for this game. This was my first Chillennium and my first time using Unity and C#.
                The theme for this game jam was "foofaraw". We created 2D platformer with 3 levels where the main character was a princess that yielded a realistic-looking pistol that she used to 
                defeat enemies in her way. Since I was the only programmer, I constructed the game physics and rules.
            </p>
            <p>In Chillennium 2017, I was in a group with one friend and two strangers- the two stragers were artists, and my friend and I were programmers. I learned from Chillennium 2016 that an iterative 
              level-based game was very hard to make in 48 hours, so I went in to this Chillennium with the idea to create a shorter game that can be replayed multiple times. 
              The theme for this game jam was "role reversal". The game we created was a two-player 2D game where every 30 seconds, the controls for each player switches, 
              causing them to control the other player's character. The goal of the game is to fill up a wheel barrel in the center of the level with a certain amount of candy.
              However, the two players are also competing to see who can contribute more candy to the pile. Whoever contributes more candy to the pile once the candy quota is met is the winner of the game. 
              I worked on the game physics, rules, and animations.

            <p>In Chillennium 2018, I was in a group with one friend and one stranger- all of us were programmers, but one of us was assigned to be an artist. The theme for this game jam was "transformation".
              The game we created was a 2D puzzle-platformer. The player is meant to control a construction worker to the flag at the end of each level. However, there are not enough platforms for the player
              to reach the goal, so we implemented a building system where the player can place a limited number of platforms in order to reach the goal. I worked on the game physics, rules,
              the level design of each stage, and animations. This game was a Chillennium Award Finalist, but unfortunately did not win an award.

            <h2>Elementary School Coding Lessons</h2>
            <p>One of my parents is a 5th grade teacher and she has told me about how her school participates in the Hour of Code, which aims to teach coding to children of all ages. The students were very
              receptive to the Hour of Code, so my step mother asked me to come to her class and teach coding lessons to her students during my breaks from school. 
              I now go twice a year, once during winter break and once during summer break, to teach her students different programming concepts.
            </p>
            <p>I've done several lessons with her students including a tic-tac-toe AI in C++, a rock-paper-scissors game in Java, and a clicking game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
              The students are always very excited to learn, and I find it extremely rewarding to pass on some of my knowledge so that some of her students may pursue computer science in the future.

            <h2>Hackathons</h2>
            <p>TAMUhack is a 24 hour hackathon hosted by Texas A&M that takes place every year. Each contestant has the option to join a team or work solo. I participated in the Fall 2016
              TAMUhack individually. I practiced my skills with Python and created a simple statistical analysis program that, when given a set of data, can return the mean, median, mode, range,
              standard deviation, and various other data.
            </p>

            <p>HowdyHack is a hackathon that is hosted by Aggie Coding Club, and the rules are the same as TAMUhack. I worked with one other person when I participated in the Fall 2018
              HowdyHack. Together, we brainstormed an idea to create a chatbot that professors could use to provide answers to their students for frequently asked questions. For example,
              if a student wants to know the date of the next exam, rather than sending an email to the professor, the idea was to make a chatbot that a professor can customize and link on
              their teacher website that will answer the student's question. We made a prototype using Microsoft Azure, which makes use of natural language processing and machine learning to
              match a set of questions to a set of answers.

            <h2>Aggie Coding Club</h2>
            <p>Aggie Coding Club is an organization at Texas A&M University that promotes teamwork on extracurricular projects. Every semester, we have project groups meet during the week to develop
              some kind of software as a team. The project ideas come directly from members, and the project managers are selected to lead a group to work on a project.
            </p>
            <p>I have been a member of Aggie Coding Club since 2016. I was selected to be a project manager by the officers for two consecutive semesters. The first team I led was creating an
              app to help factory workers voice their complaints with working conditions anonymously over SMS messaging. The other team I led wanted to make an app for resident advisors in on-campus dorms.
              The app would contain an easy lookup for rules and emergency protocols that the resident advisors would be able to access much quicker than their current method of flipping through a large 
              stack of papers.
            </p>
            <p>I was also a team member in the construction of the Aggie Coding Club website. This was my first experience with web development. We used React.js to edit the existing website. I mainly edited
              and organized the existing HTML and CSS files to make future development easier and more streamlined.

            <h2>Random Choice Generator Android App</h2>
            <p>Whenever I have to decide where my friends and I should go eat, I often find myself overwhelmed with choices. To remedy this, I created an android app that, when given a set of inputted
              choices, will pick a random choice from the list. This has resolved many mental deadlocks for my friends and me. I made this app using Android Studio, which uses Java for the 
              backend and an extremely customizable XML for the front end.

            <h2>Sound Visualizer</h2>
            <p>I had always wanted a sound visualizer for Spotify like the one that comes built into iTunes. This motivated me to want to make an online sound visualizer using HTML and JavaScript.
              I used an API called the Web Audio API that can continuously analyze the frequencies and volume of an inputted sound. I used this functionality to make boxes raise and lower depending on
              which frequencies are the loudest at any given time. It can only take in mp3 files currently, but I have plans to improve this project and potentially integrate it with Spotify.

            <h2>Greenfoot Game</h2>
            <p>Greenfoot is a simple game development engine that uses Java to display graphics and control gameplay. I had attempted to make a game that
              emulates the style of a game called Undertale. I wanted to see if I could implement the gameplay and rules of Undertale, so I created a game that uses many of the art assets
              and music from the game.
