            <h2>Chillennium</h2>
            <p>Chillennium is an annual student-led 48 hour game design competition. A theme is provided by the
              organization and then teams of up to 4 people work together to design a game within the allotted time
              and in accordance with the given theme. The games are graded by pre-selected judges after the game jam is finished.
              Awards are then given out based on the judges' scores.
              I have participated every year since 2016.

          <p id="chillennium2016Animator">In Chillennium 2016, I was in a group with 3 other people I had never met
            before- two artists and an animator. I was the sole programmer for this game.
            This was my first Chillennium and my first time using Unity and C#. The theme for this game jam was
            "foofaraw". We created a 2D platformer with 3
            levels where the main character was a princess that yielded a pistol that she used to
            defeat enemies in her way. Since I was the only programmer, I constructed the game physics and rules.
          </p>
          <div id="chillennium2017Animator">
            <p>In Chillennium 2017, I was in a group with one friend and two strangers- the two strangers were artists,
              and my friend and I were both programmers. I learned from Chillennium 2016 that an iterative
              level-based game was very hard to make in 48 hours, so I went into this Chillennium with the idea to
              create a shorter game that could be replayed multiple times.
              The theme for this game jam was "role reversal". The game we created was a two-player 2D game where every
              30 seconds, the controls for each player switches,
              causing them to control the other player's character. The goal of the game is to fill up a wheel barrel
              in the center of the level with a certain amount of candy.
              However, the two players are also competing to see who can contribute more candy to the pile. Whoever
              contributes more candy to the pile once the candy quota is met is the winner of the game.
              I worked on the game physics, rules, and animations.

              one of us was assigned to be an artist. The theme for this game jam was "transformation".
              The game we created was a 2D puzzle-platformer where the player is meant to control a construction worker
              to reach the flag at the end of the level. In each level, the player is responsible for placing a limited number of
              platforms in order to cross the gap to reach the goal on the other side. I worked on the game physics, rules,
              the level design of each stage, and animations. This game was a Chillennium Award Finalist.

          <p>I had always wanted access to a sound visualizer for Spotify like the one that comes built into iTunes. This
            motivated me to want to make an online sound visualizer using HTML and JavaScript.
            I used an API called the Web Audio API that can continuously analyze the frequencies and volume of an
            inputted sound. I used this functionality to make boxes raise and lower depending on
            which frequencies are the loudest at any given time. It can only take in .mp3 files currently, but I have
            plans to improve this project and potentially integrate it with Spotify.

          <p>Greenfoot is a simple game development engine that uses Java to display graphics and control gameplay. This
            project
            was my attempt to make a game that
            emulates the style of a game called Undertale. I wanted to see if I could implement the gameplay and rules
            of Undertale, so I created a game that uses many of the art assets
            and music from the game, with the programming for the game done entirely by me.

            choices, will pick a random choice from the list. This has resolved many mental deadlocks for my friends
            and me. I made this app using Android Studio, which uses Java for the

          <p> I participated in the Fall 2016
            TAMUhack individually. I practiced my skills with Python and created a simple statistical analysis program
            that, when given a set of data, can return the mean, median, mode, range,
            standard deviation, and various other data.

          <p>I participated in the Spring 2019 TAMUhack in a group of 5 programmers. We worked on a browser application
            using Node.js.
            Our goal was to create an online multiplayer game where users would all be presented with a tweet from Twitter
            and then be prompted to give the tweet a hashtag. All players would vote on their favorite hashtag, and the user with
            the most votes at the end of the round would be the winner. I worked on the front end of the website with one
            other person
            and we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>HowdyHack is a hackathon that is hosted by Aggie Coding Club, and the rules are the same as TAMUhack. I
            worked with one other person when I participated in the Fall 2018
            HowdyHack. Together, we brainstormed an idea to create a chatbot that professors could use to provide
            answers to their students for frequently asked questions. For example,
            if a student wants to know the date of the next exam, rather than sending an email to the professor, the
            idea was to make a chatbot that a professor can customize and link on
            their teacher website that will answer the student's question. We made a prototype using Microsoft Azure,
            which makes use of natural language processing and machine learning to
            match a set of questions to a set of answers.

          <p>Aggie Coding Club is an organization at Texas A&M University that promotes teamwork on extracurricular
            projects. Every semester, we have project groups meet during the week to develop
            some kind of software as a team. The project ideas come directly from club members, and the club officers select 
            a group of project managers to lead a project group. I have been a member of Aggie Coding Club since 2016.
          </p>
          <p>I was selected to be a project manager by the
            officers for two consecutive semesters. The first team I led was creating an
            app to help factory workers voice their complaints with working conditions anonymously over SMS messaging.
            The other team I led wanted to make an app for resident advisors in on-campus dorms.
            The app would contain an easy lookup system for rules and emergency protocols that the resident advisors
            would be
            able to access much quicker than their current method of flipping through a large
            stack of papers.
          </p>
          <p>I was also a team member in the construction of the Aggie Coding Club website. This was my first
            experience with web development. We used React.js to edit the existing website. I mainly edited
            and organized the existing HTML and CSS files to make future development easier and more streamlined.

            receptive to the Hour of Code, so my step mother asked me to come to her class and teach coding lessons to
            her students during my breaks from school.
          </p>
          <p>I've done several lessons with her students including a tic-tac-toe AI in C++, a rock-paper-scissors game
            in Java, and a mouse-clicking game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            The students are always very excited to learn, and I find it extremely rewarding to pass on some of my
            knowledge so that some of her students may pursue computer science in the future.

          <p>This was a project-based course that consisted of three two-week-long sketches followed by a
            one-month-long final project.
            Each sketch was done in teams of 4 to 6 people, where each team was composed of both artists and
            programmers.
          </p>
          <p>The final project that I worked on with a team of 4 artists and 2 programmers was a VR game called
            Reflector VR.
            In this game, the player is put in the center of a testing facility where turrets spawn all around the
            player in a circle
            and bombard them with lasers fired from all directions. The player has a shield, which reflects the lasers
            back to the turrets,
            and a gun that can fire small lasers in quick succession. There are 3 levels and the goal is to destroy all
            the turrets and
            survive until the end of the game.

          <p>Some of the topics covered in this class include the graphics pipeline, using matrix stacks to transform
            objects, writing vertex and fragment shaders in GLSL
            for multiple objects in a scene, translating coordinates into different coordinate spaces, lighting and
            cameras, texturing, using spline curves
            to interpolate a model between keyframes, skinning, and ray tracing.
          </p>

          <h2>Programming Studio</h2>
          <p>This course allowed me to work in different groups to produce several software projects. For each project,
            we used Git for source control.</p>
          <p>I volunteered to be the team leader and learned how to manage a group of programmers efficiently
            so we could produce a project before the deadline. The projects taught me how to create and use
            client-server relationships, databases,
            basic artificial intelligence concepts, and graphical user interfaces. We also learned how to develop
            projects using Agile methodology.
          </p>
          <p>My final group project involved creating a graphical user interface for a game we had previously made. We
            also had to consult a chosen panel of reviewers
            who critiqued the game after each step in the development process. The resulting game is a culmination of
            the suggestions from the users as well as
            quality-of-life improvements implemented by the developers.

          <h2>Computer Organization</h2>
          <p>In this course, we were instructed to build all of the hardware and software components that make a
            computer function.
            I was exposed to many low-level programming concepts in this course including assembly and machine
            language.</p>
          <p>I built a fully functional computer from first principles and built and successfully ran rudimentary
            graphics on it.
            I also learned how to construct basic logic gates, as well as arithmetic, logic, and sequential chips.
            I crafted a simple processor architecture through an intuitive machine language supported with
            an implementation of
            higher abstractions including a virtual machine, compiler, and a Java-based high-level object oriented
            language called Jack.</p>
          <p>As an end-of-course project, I created a game using the computer we had constructed.</p>

          <h2>Computer Systems</h2>
          <p>I constructed and learned about several different components that make up a UNIX operating system.</p>
          <p>I used C++ in conjunction with a UNIX library to create a memory management system, a bash shell, and
            several inter-process communication methods- shared memory,
            named and unnamed pipes, and message queues. I also utilized threads and semaphores to implement
            client-server relationships to allow for data transfer.

          <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
          <p>Throughout the duration of this course, I created a simple operating system that can be booted from an
            image file.</p>
          <p>The operating system I made was written in C++. The components that I made included a frame manager and
            page manager to implement
            virtual memory, threads and a thread scheduler for concurrently running programs, support for
            multiprogramming with I/O bound threads,
            and a custom file system that I had to design and implement.

          <h2>Computer and Network Security</h2>
          <p>This course provided a brief overview of various computer vulnerabilities, cyber threats, and how to defend
            against them.</p>
          <p>I learned about buffer overflow vulnerabilities, public key and private key cryptography, hash functions,
            TCP/IP vulnerabilities and defenses,
            firewalls, and the network stack. To understand threats to security, this class provided a digital
            environment where I executed various attacks and
            learned what safeguards exist to prevent the attacks from succeeding.
